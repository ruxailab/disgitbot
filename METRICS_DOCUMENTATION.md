# Metrics Documentation

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive information about the metrics system implemented in the PR Review Automation and Discord Bot pipeline. The system tracks various code quality and contribution metrics across GitHub repositories.

## Current Metrics Implementation

### 1. PR (Pull Request) Metrics

**Data Collected:**
- Lines added/deleted
- Files changed
- Functions added
- Cyclomatic complexity increase
- Risk level assessment
- Risk factors identification

**Risk Assessment Algorithm:**
```python
# Risk Level Calculation
risk_score = 0
risk_factors = []

# Large changes
if lines_added > 500:
    risk_score += 3
    risk_factors.append("Large addition (>500 lines)")

if files_changed > 15:
    risk_score += 2
    risk_factors.append("Many files changed (>15)")

# Complexity factors
if functions_added > 10:
    risk_score += 2
    risk_factors.append("Many new functions (>10)")

if cyclomatic_complexity > 50:
    risk_score += 3
    risk_factors.append("High complexity increase")

# Risk levels: LOW (0-2), MEDIUM (3-5), HIGH (6+)
```

**Output Example:**
```json
{
  "lines_added": 245,
  "lines_deleted": 12,
  "files_changed": 8,
  "functions_added": 3,
  "cyclomatic_complexity_added": 15,
  "risk_level": "MEDIUM",
  "risk_factors": ["Large addition (>200 lines)"]
}
```

### 2. Contributor Metrics

**Individual Contributor Tracking:**
- Pull requests (daily, weekly, monthly, all-time)
- GitHub issues reported (daily, weekly, monthly, all-time)
- Commits (daily, weekly, monthly, all-time)
- Activity streaks and averages
- Rankings across all time periods

**Data Structure:**
```json
{
  "username": "contributor_name",
  "stats": {
    "pr": {
      "daily": 2,
      "weekly": 8,
      "monthly": 25,
      "all_time": 150,
      "current_streak": 3,
      "longest_streak": 12,
      "avg_per_day": 1.2
    },
    "issue": {
      "daily": 1,
      "weekly": 4,
      "monthly": 15,
      "all_time": 89
    },
    "commit": {
      "daily": 5,
      "weekly": 35,
      "monthly": 120,
      "all_time": 2500
    }
  },
  "rankings": {
    "pr": 3,
    "pr_daily": 1,
    "pr_weekly": 2,
    "pr_monthly": 3
  }
}
```

### 3. Repository Metrics

- Repository health indicators
- Label distribution analysis

**Discord Integration:**

### 4. Hall of Fame System

**Leaderboard Categories:**
- Pull Requests (all-time, monthly, weekly, daily)
- GitHub Issues Reported (all-time, monthly, weekly, daily)
- Commits (all-time, monthly, weekly, daily)

**Medal System:**
- PR Champion, PR Runner-up, PR Bronze roles
- Automatic role assignment based on all-time PR rankings
- Aesthetic themed roles with emojis and pastel colors

## Configuration

### 1. Firestore Collections

**Structure:**
```
repo_stats/
├── metrics              # Repository aggregate metrics
├── hall_of_fame         # Leaderboard data
├── analytics           # Processed analytics data
└── contributor_summary  # Top contributor rankings

discord/
└── {user_id}           # Individual user contribution data

pr_config/
└── reviewers           # PR reviewer pool configuration

repository_labels/
└── {repo_name}         # Repository-specific label data
```

### 2. Pipeline Configuration

**Data Flow:**
1. **Data Collection**: GitHub API calls for repositories, PRs, issues, commits
2. **Processing**: Raw data → structured contributions → rankings → analytics
3. **Storage**: Firestore collections updated with processed data
4. **Discord Updates**: Roles and channel names updated automatically

**Update Frequency:**
- Currently: Daily via GitHub Actions
- Configurable: Can be adjusted to any frequency (5-minute intervals supported)

### 3. Role Configuration

**Badge System:**
```python
# PR Roles (Flower theme, pink pastels)
